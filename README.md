# controlling-program-flow-java-se-11-developer-certification-1z0-819

Hi everyone. My name is Collins Tshuma. Welcome to Controlling Program Flow in Java. You know, having a thorough understanding of application control flow is important for every software developer and not understanding provides a critical foundation for doing well on the Java development sphere. This repository covers everything you need to develop that understanding and it also includes pointers on some specific scenarios you should be prepared for on if you are to embark on this path. Some of the major topics we cover include conditional logic, working with switch statements, looping behavior, complex looping and branching. Before beginning, you should already have experience working with Java, and you should be familiar with the fundamentals of the Java programming language. If not, I'd encourage you to first check out beginner java courses such as "Getting Started with Programming in Java" on Pluralsight. So now, I hope you'll join me as we develop a thorough understanding of Java application control flow.
